\title{Fit distance-sampling model to pronghorn line-transect data}
\usage{
fitDistSampModel(
  ddf,
  sdf,
  keyFun = "halfnorm",
  wHi = 200,
  sidesSurveyed = 1,
  areaMi2,
  bootIterations = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ddf}{Detection data.  See \code{Rdistance::dfuncEstim} and
\code{Rdistance::abundEstim}.}

\item{sdf}{Site data.  See \code{Rdistance::abundEstim}.}

\item{keyFun}{Shape of detection curve.  See \code{Rdistance::dfuncEstim}.}

\item{wHi}{Right truncation distance.  See \code{Rdistance::dfuncEstim}.
Default is 200 m, given the pronghorn survey strip is 200 m wide.}

\item{sidesSurveyed}{Sides of the aircraft surveyed.  Default is 1, given the
current protocol specifies 1 observer looking out 1 side of the aircraft.
Rdistance assumes 2 sides of the line are surveyed, so this allows the survey
strip area to be adjusted accordingly.}

\item{areaMi2}{Size of the area (in square miles) that the abundance estimate
is extrapolated to.  This is often the total area of the herd unit, but areas
not occupiable by pronghorn (e.g., forested areas) should be excluded.}

\item{bootIterations}{Number of bootstrap iterations to use to calculate
confidence intervals.  See \code{Rdistance::abundEstim}.  If 0 (the default),
no bootstrap is run and no CIs are generated.}
}
\value{
An 'abundance estimate' object.  Same as returned by
\code{Rdistance::abundEstim}.
}
\description{
Estimate abundance of pronghorn using distance sampling.
Distance-sampling models are fit using the Rdistance package.
This is a thin wrapper around \code{Rdistance::dfuncEstim} and
\code{Rdistance::abundEstim}.
